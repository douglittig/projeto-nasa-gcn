# MAGIC ## Generative AI Application Development
# MAGIC
# MAGIC This course provides participants with information and practical experience in building advanced LLM (Large Language Model) applications using multi-stage reasoning LLM chains and agents. In the initial section, participants will learn how to decompose a problem into its components and select the most suitable model for each step to enhance business use cases. Following this, participants will construct a multi-stage reasoning chain utilizing LangChain and HuggingFace transformers. Finally, participants will be introduced to agents and will design an autonomous agent using generative models on Databricks.
