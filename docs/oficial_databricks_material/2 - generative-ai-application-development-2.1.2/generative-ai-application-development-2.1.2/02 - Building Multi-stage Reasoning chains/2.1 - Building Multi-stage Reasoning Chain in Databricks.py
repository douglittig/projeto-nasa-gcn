# MAGIC # Building Multi-stage Reasoning Chain in Databricks
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this demo we will start building a multi-stage reasoning system using Databricks' features and LangChain. Before we build the chain, first, we will show various components that are commonly used in multi-stage chaining system. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In the main section of the demo, we will build a multi-stage system. First, we will build a chain that will answer user questions using `llama-3` model. The second chain will search for DAIS-2023 talks and will try to find the corresponding video on YouTube. The final, complete chain will recommend videos to the user.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Learning Objectives:**
# MAGIC
# MAGIC *By the end of this demo, you will be able to;*
# MAGIC
# MAGIC * Identify that LangChain can include stages/tasks that are not LLMs.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC * Create basic LLM chains to connect prompts and LLMs.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC * Use tools to complete various tasks in the complete system.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC * Construct sequential chains of multiple LLMChains to perform multi-stage reasoning analysis.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC Please review the following requirements before starting the lesson:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC * To run this notebook, you need to use one of the following Databricks runtime(s): **15.4.x-cpu-ml-scala2.12**
# MAGIC

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ## Classroom Setup
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Before starting the demo, run the provided classroom setup script. This script will define configuration variables necessary for the demo. Execute the following cell:

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %pip install -U -qq databricks-sdk databricks-vectorsearch langchain-databricks langchain==0.3.7 langchain-community==0.3.7 youtube_search Wikipedia grandalf
# MAGIC
# MAGIC dbutils.library.restartPython()

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %run ../Includes/Classroom-Setup-02

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC **Other Conventions:**
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Throughout this demo, we'll refer to the object `DA`. This object, provided by Databricks Academy, contains variables such as your username, catalog name, schema name, working directory, and dataset locations. Run the code block below to view these details:

# COMMAND ----------

print(f"Username:          {DA.username}")
print(f"Catalog Name:      {DA.catalog_name}")
print(f"Schema Name:       {DA.schema_name}")
print(f"Working Directory: {DA.paths.working_dir}")
print(f"Dataset Location:  {DA.paths.datasets}")

# MAGIC ## Using LLMs and Prompts without an External Library
# MAGIC
# MAGIC While there are many libraries out there for building chains and in this demo we will be using one as well, you don't need a third party library for a simple prompt. We can simply use `databricks-sdk` to directly query an **Foundational Model API endpoint**. 
# MAGIC

# COMMAND ----------

from databricks.sdk import WorkspaceClient
from databricks.sdk.service.serving import ChatMessage

w = WorkspaceClient()

genre = "romance"
actor = "Brad Pitt"

prompt = f"Tell me about a {genre} movie which {actor} is one of the actors."

messages = [
    { 
        "role": "user", 
        "content": prompt 
    }
]
messages = [ChatMessage.from_dict(message) for message in messages]
llm_response = w.serving_endpoints.query(
    name="databricks-meta-llama-3-3-70b-instruct",
    messages=messages,
    temperature=0.2,
    max_tokens=128
)

print(llm_response.as_dict()["choices"][0]["message"]["content"])

# MAGIC ## LangChain Basics
# MAGIC
# MAGIC As demonstrated in the previous section, **it is not necessary to use a third-party chaining library** to construct a multi-chain AI system. However, composition libraries like **LangChain** can simplify some of the steps by providing a generic interface for supported large language models (LLMs).
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Before we begin building a multi-stage chain, let's review the main LangChain components that we will use in this module.
# MAGIC

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ### Prompt
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Prompt is one of the basic blocks when interacting with GenAI models. They may include instructions, examples and specific context information related to the given task. Let's create a very basic prompt.
# MAGIC

# COMMAND ----------

from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate

prompt_template = PromptTemplate.from_template("Tell me about a {genre} movie which {actor} is one of the actors.")
prompt_template.format(genre="romance", actor="Brad Pitt")

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ### LLMs
# MAGIC
# MAGIC LLMs are the core component when building compound AI systems. They are the **brain** of the system for reasoning and generating the response. The [list of supported LLMs](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/integrations/chat/) can be found on LangChain documentation. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Let's see how to interact with **Llama-3** model.
# MAGIC

# COMMAND ----------

from langchain_databricks import ChatDatabricks

# You can play with max_tokens to define the length of the response
llm_llama = ChatDatabricks(endpoint="databricks-meta-llama-3-3-70b-instruct", max_tokens = 500)

for chunk in llm_llama.stream("Who is Brad Pitt?"):
    print(chunk.content, end="\n", flush=True)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ### Retriever
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Retrievers accept a string as input and return the list of documents. They are mainly used for retrieving external data and passing it to the model for generating response. Typically, retrievers don't use LLMs instead they are using similarity search under the hood to find the most similar documents. There are various types of retrievers such as *document retrievers* and *vector store retrievers*. The [list of supported retrievers](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/integrations/retrievers/) can be found on LangChain documentation. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In the next section of the demo, we will use **Databricks Vector Search** as retriever to fetch documents by input query.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC For now, let's try a simple **Wikipedia retriever**.

# COMMAND ----------

from langchain_community.retrievers import WikipediaRetriever
retriever = WikipediaRetriever()
docs = retriever.invoke(input="Brad Pitt")
print(docs[0])

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ### Tools
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Tools are functions that can be invoked in the chain. Tools has *input parameters* and a *function* to run. The [list of supported tools](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/integrations/tools/) can be found on LangChain documentation. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Here, we have a Youtube search tool. The tool's `description` defines why a tool can be used and the `args` defines what input arguments can be passed to the tool.

# COMMAND ----------

from langchain_community.tools import YouTubeSearchTool
tool = YouTubeSearchTool()
tool.run("Brad Pitt movie trailer")

# COMMAND ----------

print(tool.description)
print(tool.args)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ### Chaining
# MAGIC
# MAGIC One of the important features of these components is the ability to **chain** them together. Let's connect the LLM with the prompt.

# COMMAND ----------

from langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser

chain = prompt_template | llm_llama | StrOutputParser()
print(chain.invoke({"genre":"romance", "actor":"Brad Pitt"}))

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ### Enable MLflow Auto-Log
# MAGIC
# MAGIC MLflow has support for auto-logging LangChain models. Auto-logging is enabled by default. If not enabled, we would enable auto-logging as below.

# COMMAND ----------

import mlflow
mlflow.langchain.autolog()

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ### Create a Vector Store
# MAGIC
# MAGIC This course does not cover vector stores in depth, as they fall outside its scope. For a comprehensive understanding of vector stores, including the Databricks Vector Store, please refer to the **Generative AI Solution Development** course. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **🚨IMPORTANT: Vector Search endpoints must be created before running the rest of the demo. These are already created for you in Databricks Lab environment.**

# COMMAND ----------

# Assign VS search endpoint by username
vs_endpoint_prefix = "vs_endpoint_"

vs_endpoint_name = vs_endpoint_prefix+str(get_fixed_integer(DA.unique_name("_")))
print(f"Assigned Vector Search endpoint name: {vs_endpoint_name}.")

# Source table and VS index table names
vs_index_table_fullname = f"{DA.catalog_name}.{DA.schema_name}.dais_embeddings"
source_table_fullname = f"{DA.catalog_name}.{DA.schema_name}.dais_text"

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC The dataset that we will be using in this module is already created in the classroom setup script. Let's have a quick look at the dataset.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Then, we will create a vector store index and store embeddings there.

# COMMAND ----------

display(spark.sql(f"SELECT * FROM {source_table_fullname}"))

# COMMAND ----------

# Store embeddings in vector store
create_vs_index(vs_endpoint_name, vs_index_table_fullname, source_table_fullname, "Title")

# MAGIC ### Build First Chain
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The **first chain** will be used for listing videos relevant to the user's question. In order to get videos, first, we need to search for the DAIS-2023 talks that are already stored in a Vector Search index. After retrieving the relevant titles, we will use YouTube search tool to get the videos for the talks. In the final stage, these videos are passed to the chain to generate a response for the user.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC This chain consist of a `prompt template`, `retriever`, `llm model` and `output parser`.

# COMMAND ----------

from langchain.chains import create_retrieval_chain
from langchain.chains.combine_documents import create_stuff_documents_chain
from langchain_databricks import DatabricksVectorSearch

# Prompt to format the video titles for YouTube search
prompt_template_1 = PromptTemplate.from_template(

# MAGIC ## Conclusion
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this demo, we explored building a multi-stage reasoning system with Databricks' tools and LangChain. We began by introducing common system components and then focused on creating chains for specific tasks like answering user queries and finding DAIS-2023 talks. By the end, participants learned to use LangChain beyond just LLMs and construct sequential chains for multi-stage analyses.
